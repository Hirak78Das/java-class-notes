--> In java it compiles the entire source code into byte code(named as .class file) , not like c++ compilation i.e. binary code

-->The source code is not directly converted into machine code 0s and 1s, rather it is convertes into something called byte code which is in .class file

--> We need java virtual machine to run this byte code

--> java is a platform independence cuz:
     
     1. byte code can run on all operating systems 
        whereas, in c++ if we compile a file and run the program on windows,we need to compile it again to run  in mac but for java this byte code can be run in all OS.
     
     2. now we need to convert this byte code to machine code using java virtual machine so that computer can understand

--> How JVM works?
    
    --> it reads .class file and generate binary data
    --> an object of this class is created in heap

--> byte codes executes line by line i.e. byte codes is being converted into machine code line by line by JVM
